# Big-Data
my big-data application for sentiment analysis based on lexicon approach and pyspark

Firstly,
to execute spark streaming u should execute twitter-listener first in anaconda prompt, after that 
u can execute data.ipynb in jupyter notebook, u can see the extraction of tweets in real-time ( in terminal ) 
and u can see the visualization of the most famous tags in the jupyter File.

Now, the File preprocess + sentiment includes the batch processing of a simple dataset ( Qatar2022), 
i want to do the preprocess in the streaming also i want the visualization of the result (sentiment) in jupyter notebook.

Thanks.
